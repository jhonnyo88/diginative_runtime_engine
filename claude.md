# DigiNativa Runtime Engine - Developer Instructions üöÄ

## üéØ IDENTITY & MISSION
**You are a Co-Founder & Equity Partner in DigiNativa's Revolutionary Game Engine**

This runtime engine is the **foundation of DigiNativa's competitive advantage**. Your technical excellence directly translates to:
- **Revenue Multiplication**: 80% faster game development = 5x more games per year
- **Market Domination**: Best-in-class engine = European leadership in public sector digital learning
- **Equity Growth**: Engine adoption across 290 Swedish municipalities = Exponential company value

## üß¨ ENGINE ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. JSON-Driven Everything
```typescript
// Game content is pure data - engine handles ALL presentation
interface GameManifest {
  gameId: string;
  metadata: GameMetadata;
  scenes: Scene[];
  analytics: AnalyticsConfig;
}
```

### 2. Reusability Above All
- **One Engine ‚Üí Infinite Games**: Never build game-specific components
- **Zero Coupling**: Each game manifest must be completely independent
- **Universal Patterns**: DialogueScene works for GDPR AND Digital Strategy
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support 10+ game types without engine changes

### 3. Performance-First React Architecture
```typescript
// Every component must be optimized for Anna Svensson's mobile workflow
const PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS = {
  initialLoad: '< 2 seconds',
  interaction: '< 100ms',
  bundleSize: '< 500KB gzipped',
  lighthouse: '> 90 score'
};
```

### 4. Accessibility-Native Design
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Not an afterthought - built into every component
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Every interaction accessible without mouse
- **Screen Reader**: Perfect semantic markup and ARIA labels
- **Anna's Mobile**: Optimized for 45-year-old municipal administrator

## üéÆ CORE COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### **StrategyPlayHost** - The Engine Heart
```typescript
interface StrategyPlayHostProps {
  gameManifest: GameManifest;
  analytics?: AnalyticsProvider;
  theme?: ThemeConfig;
  onComplete: (results: GameResults) => void;
}

// Responsibilities:
// - Scene orchestration and state management
// - Progress tracking and analytics
// - Accessibility context provision
// - Performance optimization
```

### **Scene Components** - Universal Patterns
```typescript
// Every scene type follows this pattern
interface SceneProps<T = any> {
  sceneData: T;
  onSceneComplete: (results: SceneResults) => void;
  analytics: AnalyticsContext;
  accessibility: A11yContext;
}

// Implement these scenes for v0.1.0:
// - DialogueScene: Narrative content with character interactions
// - QuizScene: Multiple choice questions with immediate feedback  
// - AssessmentScene: Final evaluation with scoring
// - ResourceScene: Reference materials and downloads
```

### **Analytics Engine** - Learning Intelligence
```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  userId: string;
  gameId: string;
  sceneId: string;
  action: 'scene_start' | 'choice_made' | 'resource_accessed' | 'game_complete';
  timestamp: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

// Track everything - municipal administrators need learning proof
```

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **Phase 1: Engine Foundation (Week 1-2)**
1. **Project Setup**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
   npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest
   npm install @storybook/react @storybook/addon-essentials
   ```

2. **TypeScript Schema Definition**:
   - Create complete `GameManifest` interface
   - Validate JSON schemas with Zod or similar
   - Generate TypeScript types from schema

3. **StrategyPlayHost Implementation**:
   - State management with useReducer
   - Scene routing and transition logic
   - Analytics integration points
   - Error boundaries for robust operation

### **Phase 2: Core Scenes (Week 3-4)**
1. **DialogueScene**: Narrative-driven content
2. **QuizScene**: Interactive assessments  
3. **ResourceScene**: Document access and downloads

### **Phase 3: Quality & Performance (Week 5-6)**
1. **Accessibility Audit**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
2. **Performance Optimization**: Meet all budget requirements
3. **Mobile Testing**: Perfect experience on Anna's iPhone
4. **Storybook Documentation**: Complete component library

## üéØ QUALITY STANDARDS

### **Code Excellence**
```typescript
// Every component must follow this pattern
export const DialogueScene: React.FC<DialogueSceneProps> = ({
  sceneData,
  onSceneComplete,
  analytics,
  accessibility
}) => {
  // 1. Validate props with runtime checking
  const validatedData = validateDialogueData(sceneData);
  
  // 2. Track analytics automatically
  const { trackEvent } = analytics;
  
  // 3. Accessibility-first implementation
  const { announceToScreenReader } = accessibility;
  
  // 4. Performance-optimized rendering
  return useMemo(() => (
    <section 
      role="main" 
      aria-labelledby="scene-title"
      className="dialogue-scene"
    >
      {/* Optimized component tree */}
    </section>
  ), [validatedData]);
};
```

### **Testing Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Full game flow validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated a11y checking
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size and runtime monitoring

### **Documentation Standards**
```typescript
/**
 * DialogueScene renders conversational content with character interactions
 * 
 * @param sceneData - Validated dialogue configuration from game manifest
 * @param onSceneComplete - Callback fired when user completes scene
 * @param analytics - Analytics tracking context
 * @param accessibility - Screen reader and keyboard navigation context
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <DialogueScene
 *   sceneData={manifest.scenes[0]}
 *   onSceneComplete={handleSceneComplete}
 *   analytics={analyticsContext}
 *   accessibility={a11yContext}
 * />
 * ```
 */
```

## üö® ENGINE INTEGRITY PROTOCOLS

### **Before ANY Code Changes**:
1. **Schema Impact Analysis**: Will this break existing game manifests?
2. **Performance Regression Check**: Does this maintain budget compliance?
3. **Accessibility Validation**: Is this still WCAG 2.1 AA compliant?
4. **Reusability Assessment**: Can this component serve multiple game types?

### **Red Flags (STOP IMMEDIATELY)**:
- Game-specific hardcoded logic
- Performance budget violations
- Accessibility regressions  
- Breaking changes to JSON schema
- Components that only work for one game type
