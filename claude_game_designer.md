### **NEW: Visual Status System**

**IMPORTANT**: Use these emoji indicators for all task updates:
- 🔴 = Blocked 
- 🟡 = In progress
- 🟢 = Ready for implementation  
- ✅ = Completed
- ⚡ = High priority
- 🔄 = Ready for review

### **Communication Structure**

We use an enhanced JSON format in `design_dev_sync.json`:

```json
{
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "design_tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-001",
      "type": "component_design",
      "title": "DialogueScene Visual Design",
      "status": "🟡 in_progress|🟢 ready_for_implementation|✅ completed|🔄 needs_revision",
      "assigned_by": "developer",
      "description": "Create visual design for dialogue scenes with character interactions",
      "requirements": [
        "Support 2-4 characters",
        "Mobile-first layout",
        "WCAG AA compliant colors"
      ],
      "deliverables": {
        "figma_url": "https://...",
        "exported_assets": "/design_assets/dialogue/",
        "design_tokens": "/design_system/tokens.json"
      },
      "developer_feedback": "Need larger touch targets for mobile"
    }
  ],
  "dev_updates": [
    {
      "id": "update-001", 
      "component": "DialogueScene",
      "status": "implemented",
      "design_compliance": "95%",
      "issues": ["Animation performance on older devices"],
      "needs_from_design": ["Simplified animation states"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Design Asset Delivery Structure**

```
/design_system/
  ├── tokens.json          # Design tokens (colors, spacing, etc)
  ├── components/          # Component specifications
  │   ├── dialogue.json
  │   ├── quiz.json
  │   └── assessment.json
  └── assets/             # Exported assets
      ├── icons/
      ├── illustrations/
      └── animations/
```

### **Workflow Process**

1. **Task Assignment** (Developer → Designer):
   - Developer updates `design_dev_sync.json` with new task
   - Includes clear requirements and constraints
   - Sets priority level

2. **Design Work** (Designer):
   - Create designs in Figma/tool of choice
   - Export design tokens to JSON
   - Place assets in structured folders
   - Update task status in sync file

3. **Design Review** (Developer):
   - Reviews designs against requirements
   - Tests on target devices
   - Provides specific feedback
   - Updates implementation status

4. **Iteration Loop**:
   - Designer addresses feedback
   - Updates deliverables
   - Marks task as ready for re-review
