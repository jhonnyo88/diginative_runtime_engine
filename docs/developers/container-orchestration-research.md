# Container Orchestration Research for Municipal Scaling

**Project:** DigiNative Runtime Engine  
**Roadmap Ref:** Q2-Scaling-Infrastructure (proposal-016)  
**Research Phase:** Planning Only - No Implementation  
**Target:** Q2 scaling decisions for 5-100 municipalities  

## Executive Summary

This research evaluates container orchestration solutions for scaling DigiNative Runtime Engine to support 5-100+ municipalities with government-grade security and compliance requirements. The analysis covers Kubernetes vs alternatives, managed service options, cost implications, and migration strategies.

### Key Research Questions
1. **Platform Selection:** Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm vs managed alternatives
2. **Cloud Provider:** AWS EKS vs Google GKE vs Azure AKS for municipal compliance
3. **Cost Analysis:** Total cost of ownership for 5-100 municipality scenarios
4. **Security:** Government compliance requirements and multi-tenant security
5. **Migration:** Strategy from current architecture to containerized deployment
6. **European Expansion:** Multi-region deployment for Klaus/Marie/Pieter personas

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure (Q1 Complete)
- **Application Layer:** Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database:** MySQL with tenant partitioning

## Municipal Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Deployment Models Evaluated

#### 1. Cluster-per-Municipality (Maximum Isolation)
```yaml
# Dedicated cluster for each municipality
Municipality: Malmö Stad
Cluster: malmo-stad-prod
Namespace: default
Isolation: Complete
Security: Maximum
Cost: High ($630/month per municipality)
```

**Pros:** Complete isolation, easy compliance, municipal-specific scaling  
**Cons:** High cost, operational complexity, resource inefficiency  
**Recommendation:** Use for premium tier municipalities only  

#### 2. Namespace-per-Municipality (Balanced Approach)
```yaml
# Shared cluster with municipal namespaces
Cluster: diginnative-nordic-prod
Namespaces:
  - malmo-stad
  - goteborg-stad  
  - stockholm-stad
  - berlin-de
Isolation: Logical
Security: High (with network policies)
Cost: Medium ($630/month for 4 municipalities)
```

**Pros:** Cost effective, good isolation, easier operations  
**Cons:** Shared control plane, potential noisy neighbor issues  
**Recommendation:** Primary deployment model for Q2-Q3  

#### 3. Pod-Level Multi-Tenancy (High Density)
```yaml
# Single namespace with tenant-aware applications
Cluster: diginative-europe-prod
Namespace: production
Pods: tenant-aware with municipality context
Isolation: Application-level
Security: Depends on application
Cost: Low ($425/month for 20 municipalities)
```

**Pros:** Maximum cost efficiency, simple operations  
**Cons:** Requires application-level isolation, security concerns  
**Recommendation:** Consider for future optimization  

### Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Approach

## Migration Strategy from Current Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
1. **Cluster Setup**
   - Provision Azure AKS clusters in target regions
   - Configure networking, security, and monitoring
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for container deployment

2. **Containerization**
   - Create Docker images for all services
   - Implement health checks and graceful shutdown
   - Optimize for Kubernetes deployment patterns

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Convert environment variables to ConfigMaps/Secrets
   - Implement Helm charts for deployment templates
   - Set up municipal-specific value overrides

### Phase 2: Pilot Migration (Months 3-4)
1. **Single Municipality Pilot**
   - Deploy one municipality (suggest Malmö Stad) to Kubernetes
   - Run parallel deployment for validation
   - Monitor performance and stability

2. **Data Migration Strategy**
   - Implement database replication to Kubernetes-hosted MySQL
   - Migrate Redis data with minimal downtime
   - Validate tenant isolation in new environment

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run full E2E test suite against Kubernetes deployment
   - Validate municipal isolation and security
   - Performance testing to confirm <2s/<30s requirements

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Months 5-6)
1. **Regional Migration**
   - Migrate Swedish municipalities to Nordic cluster
   - Migrate German municipalities to German cluster
   - Validate cross-region functionality

2. **Traffic Shifting**
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy
   - Gradual traffic shifting with monitoring
   - Rollback procedures for each municipality

3. **Legacy Decommission**
   - Monitor old infrastructure for 30 days
   - Decommission legacy infrastructure
   - Cost optimization and right-sizing

## Multi-Region Deployment for European Expansion

### Regional Architecture for €20M ARR Target

```yaml
# Europe-wide deployment strategy
regions:
  nordic:
    primary: Stockholm (Azure West Europe)
    backup: Oslo (if needed)
    municipalities: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish
    compliance: GDPR, Swedish DPA
    
  germany:
    primary: Frankfurt (Azure Germany West Central)  
    backup: Berlin (Azure Germany North)
    municipalities: German cities
    compliance: GDPR, BDSG (German DPA)
    
  france:
    primary: Paris (Azure France Central)
    backup: Marseille (Azure France South)
    municipalities: French cities
    compliance: GDPR, CNIL (French DPA)
    
  netherlands:
    primary: Amsterdam (Azure West Europe)
    municipalities: Dutch municipalities  
    compliance: GDPR, AP (Dutch DPA)
```

### Data Residency Compliance Strategy

1. **Strict Regional Boundaries**
   - German municipal data stays in German Azure regions
   - French municipal data stays in French Azure regions
   - Cross-border access explicitly forbidden

2. **Backup and DR Strategy**
   - Regional backups within same country
   - Disaster recovery to compliant regions only
   - Encrypted backups with regional key management

3. **Network Architecture**
   - Private networking between regions
   - Azure ExpressRoute for government-grade connectivity
   - Regional API gateways for municipal access
