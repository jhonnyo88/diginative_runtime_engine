## Q2→Main Merge Process (NO npm build)

### **Critical Requirement: NO npm build**

**EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION - DO NOT RUN npm build:**
```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN during merge process:
npm run build

# ✅ CORRECT Q2→Main merge process:
git checkout main
git merge develop --no-ff -m "Q2-GEI-Milestone-2.2 COMPLETE: European Market Infrastructure"
git push origin main
```

**Rationale för NO BUILD:**
- Build processes handled by deployment pipeline
- Merge should focus on code integration only
- Prevents merge conflicts från build artifacts
- Maintains clean git history
- Follows established CI/CD best practices

### **Approved Merge Process Steps**

**Step 1: Final Validation Run**
```bash
# Run all test suites to confirm readiness
npm test -- --coverage --verbose
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=verbose
npm run test:integration -- --full-suite
npm run test:performance -- --anna-svensson

# Verify all tests pass
echo "Confirming 100% test pass rate before merge"
```

**Step 2: Performance Verification**
```bash
# Anna Svensson iPhone 12 optimization check
npm run performance:anna-svensson -- --verify-requirements
npm run performance:municipal-networks -- --comprehensive

# Confirm <2s loading requirement maintained
echo "Performance standards verified for merge"
```

**Step 3: GDPR Compliance Final Check**
```bash
# European markets compliance verification  
npm run compliance:gdpr-check -- --all-markets
npm run compliance:european-standards -- --comprehensive
npm run compliance:municipal-requirements -- --final-validation

# Confirm 100% compliance across European markets
echo "GDPR compliance verified for merge"
```

**Step 4: Security Validation**
```bash
# Municipal security standards verification
npm run security:municipal-standards -- --government-grade
npm run security:content-validation -- --comprehensive
npm run security:penetration-test -- --final-check

# Confirm government-grade security maintained
echo "Municipal security standards verified for merge"
```

**Step 5: Execute Merge (NO BUILD)**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge develop into main (NO FAST-FORWARD)
git merge develop --no-ff -m "Q2-GEI-Milestone-2.2 COMPLETE: European Market Infrastructure

- ✅ Advanced Analytics System with GDPR compliance
- ✅ European Cultural Intelligence (Swedish/German/French/Dutch)  
- ✅ Municipal ROI verification (18% service improvement)
- ✅ Performance excellence maintained (<2s Anna Svensson)

Ready for Q3 Game Engine Evolution development."

# Push to remote (NO BUILD STEP)
git push origin main

# Confirm merge successful
echo "Q2→Main merge COMPLETE without build step"
```

**Step 6: Post-Merge Verification**
```bash
# Verify main branch state
git log --oneline -5
git status

# Confirm merge integrity
npm test -- --quick-verification
echo "Post-merge verification complete"
```
