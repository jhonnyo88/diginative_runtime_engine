# DigiNativa Runtime Engine - Team Coordination Protocol 🎯

## 🎯 AUTONOMOUS ROADMAP-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

**Strategic Evolution**: From reactive task assignment to proactive, autonomous execution aligned with our strategic roadmap (`docs/developers/road_map.md`). Each team member becomes a strategic contributor, not just a task executor.

**Success Metric**: <4 hours onboarding for new team members, >85% on-time task delivery, <20% time spent on coordination overhead, **100% roadmap-aligned task creation**.

**Autonomy Goal**: Every agent proactively breaks down roadmap milestones into actionable tasks within their expertise area, ensuring continuous progress toward €25M ARR strategic objectives.

---

## 🗺️ ROADMAP-BACKLOG INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

**Mandatory Requirement**: Every task, issue, or initiative created in our backlog MUST reference the specific milestone or strategic pillar from `docs/developers/road_map.md` that it contributes to.

### **Task Tagging Structure**
```
[Task-XXX] Brief Description | Roadmap-Ref: [Milestone/Pillar Reference]

Examples:
[Task-045] Refactor Authentication System | Roadmap-Ref: Q3-Municipal-Enterprise-Readiness
[Task-067] Implement Drag-Drop Mechanics | Roadmap-Ref: Q2-Game-Experience-Innovation-Milestone-2.1
[Task-089] AI Content Validation Engine | Roadmap-Ref: Q1-Foundation-Autonomi-Milestone-1.2
```

### **Roadmap Reference Codes**
```json
{
  "strategic_pillars": {
    "autonomous_operation": "AO",
    "game_experience_innovation": "GEI", 
    "municipal_enterprise_readiness": "MER",
    "unlimited_content_scaling": "UCS"
  },
  "milestone_format": "Q[Quarter]-[Pillar]-Milestone-[Number].[Sub-number]",
  "examples": [
    "Q1-AO-Milestone-1.1",  // Q1 Autonomous Operation Milestone 1.1
    "Q2-GEI-Milestone-2.2", // Q2 Game Experience Innovation Milestone 2.2
    "Q3-MER-Milestone-3.3"  // Q3 Municipal Enterprise Readiness Milestone 3.3
  ]
}
```

### **Task Creation Validation**
- **Reject tasks without roadmap reference**: No task enters backlog without clear strategic alignment
- **Quarterly roadmap review**: Ensure all active tasks still align with current strategic priorities
- **Milestone progress tracking**: Monitor completion rate of roadmap milestones through backlog task completion

## 🔄 ASYNCHRONOUS COORDINATION WORKFLOW

**CRITICAL**: All team coordination is asynchronous. You (Head Developer) document needs and formulate specialist tasks after strategic dialog with Project Leader, who then triggers each team member based on your task assignments.

### **1. Trigger-Based Team Member Activation**

#### **How Team Members Are Activated**
```
Project Leader Strategic Dialog → Head Developer Documents Task → Project Leader Triggers Specialist → Role Works Independently → Updates design_dev_sync.json → Head Developer Reviews
```

#### **Activation Triggers by Role**
```json
{
  "system_architect_triggers": [
    "Infrastructure scaling needed",
    "Database architecture decisions",
    "Performance optimization requirements", 
    "European deployment planning"
  ],
  "game_designer_triggers": [
    "New component design needed",
    "Municipal branding requirements",
    "Accessibility design decisions",
    "Cultural adaptation updates"
  ],
  "test_engineer_triggers": [
    "Quality validation needed",
    "New testing frameworks required",
    "Performance benchmarking",
    "European compliance validation"
  ]
}
```

2. **Resolve Blockers**: Address dependencies and provide technical guidance
3. **Approve Deliverables**: Review completed work and approve next steps
4. **Prepare Next Tasks**: Document next required tasks for Project Leader to trigger
5. **Strategic Consultation**: Discuss progress and next priorities with Project Leader

### **3. Coordination Events (All Asynchronous)**

#### **Weekly Progress Review (Asynchronous)**
- **Process**: You review all role updates in `design_dev_sync.json`
- **Outcome**: Written feedback and next week priorities for each role
- **Timing**: You conduct this when convenient, team members see updates next time triggered

#### **Monthly Planning Coordination (Asynchronous)**
- **Process**: You update planning section in `design_dev_sync.json` with strategic priorities
- **Team Input**: Each role adds their capacity and resource needs when next triggered
- **Outcome**: Updated quarterly roadmap and resource allocation
