# DigiNativa Runtime Engine - Team Coordination Protocol ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸŽ¯ SCALING FROM 2 TO 4+ TEAM MEMBERS

**Critical Need**: As we scale from Head Developer + Game Designer to Head Developer + System Architect + Game Designer + Test Engineer, our coordination methodology must evolve to prevent bottlenecks and maintain velocity.

**Success Metric**: <4 hours onboarding for new team members, >85% on-time task delivery, <20% time spent on coordination overhead.

## ðŸ”„ ASYNCHRONOUS COORDINATION WORKFLOW

**CRITICAL**: All team coordination is asynchronous. You (Head Developer) document needs and formulate specialist tasks after strategic dialog with Project Leader, who then triggers each team member based on your task assignments.

### **1. Trigger-Based Team Member Activation**

#### **How Team Members Are Activated**
```
Project Leader Strategic Dialog â†’ Head Developer Documents Task â†’ Project Leader Triggers Specialist â†’ Role Works Independently â†’ Updates design_dev_sync.json â†’ Head Developer Reviews
```

#### **Activation Triggers by Role**
```json
{
  "system_architect_triggers": [
    "Infrastructure scaling needed",
    "Database architecture decisions",
    "Performance optimization requirements", 
    "European deployment planning"
  ],
  "game_designer_triggers": [
    "New component design needed",
    "Municipal branding requirements",
    "Accessibility design decisions",
    "Cultural adaptation updates"
  ],
  "test_engineer_triggers": [
    "Quality validation needed",
    "New testing frameworks required",
    "Performance benchmarking",
    "European compliance validation"
  ]
}
```

### **2. Asynchronous Work Session Protocol**

#### **Head Developer Task Formulation Process**
1. **Strategic Dialog**: Discuss needs and priorities with Project Leader
2. **Technical Analysis**: Analyze requirements and determine specialist needs
3. **Task Documentation**: Create detailed task assignments in `design_dev_sync.json`
4. **Handoff to Project Leader**: Present formulated tasks for Project Leader to trigger specialist

#### **When Project Leader Triggers a Team Member (Based on Head Developer Tasks)**
1. **Task Assignment**: Project Leader activates specialist using Head Developer's documented task
2. **Context Clarity**: All context and deliverables already documented by Head Developer
3. **Timeline Communication**: Deadlines and dependencies clearly specified
4. **Authority Reference**: Specialist knows their decision boundaries from Head Developer documentation

#### **Team Member Work Session**
1. **Read Assignment**: Review their section in `design_dev_sync.json`
2. **Work Independently**: Use their specialist expertise within defined authority
3. **Update Progress**: Regular `design_dev_sync.json` updates during work
4. **Deliver Results**: Mark complete and hand off to next role or back to Head Developer

#### **Head Developer Review Cycle**
1. **Monitor Updates**: Check `design_dev_sync.json` for progress and blockers
2. **Resolve Blockers**: Address dependencies and provide technical guidance
3. **Approve Deliverables**: Review completed work and approve next steps
4. **Prepare Next Tasks**: Document next required tasks for Project Leader to trigger
5. **Strategic Consultation**: Discuss progress and next priorities with Project Leader

### **3. Coordination Events (All Asynchronous)**

#### **Weekly Progress Review (Asynchronous)**
- **Process**: You review all role updates in `design_dev_sync.json`
- **Outcome**: Written feedback and next week priorities for each role
- **Timing**: You conduct this when convenient, team members see updates next time triggered

#### **Monthly Planning Coordination (Asynchronous)**
- **Process**: You update planning section in `design_dev_sync.json` with strategic priorities
- **Team Input**: Each role adds their capacity and resource needs when next triggered
- **Outcome**: Updated quarterly roadmap and resource allocation

#### **Milestone Coordination (Event-Driven)**
- **Trigger**: Major deliverable completion or deadline approach
- **Process**: Sequential role activation for milestone validation
- **Example**: Design complete â†’ Trigger Head Developer â†’ Review â†’ Trigger Test Engineer â†’ Validate â†’ Trigger System Architect â†’ Deploy

## ðŸš¨ ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION & ESCALATION PROTOCOL

### **Communication Flow (All Asynchronous)**
```
Level 1: design_dev_sync.json updates (Primary communication method)
Level 2: Head Developer review and guidance (You review and respond)
Level 3: Role-specific task assignment (You trigger appropriate specialist)
Level 4: Completion notification and handoff (Role completes, you review)
```

### **Team Member Communication Rules**
- **Primary Channel**: `design_dev_sync.json` updates only
- **No Direct Role-to-Role Communication**: All coordination goes through Head Developer
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress updates in their assigned tasks
- **Blocker Reporting**: Immediate documentation of any blocking issues

### **Head Developer Communication Responsibilities**
```json
{
  "strategic_consultation": "Dialog with Project Leader on needs, priorities, and technical direction",
  "task_formulation": "Document detailed specialist tasks with context, deliverables, and authority boundaries",
  "technical_monitoring": "Review design_dev_sync.json for progress, blockers, and quality",
  "blocker_resolution": "Address technical blocking issues within 4-24 hours",
  "progress_feedback": "Provide technical guidance and approval for specialist deliverables",
  "next_task_preparation": "Identify and document next required specialist tasks for Project Leader triggering"
}
```

### **Project Leader Communication Responsibilities**
```json
{
  "strategic_guidance": "Provide high-level direction and priorities to Head Developer",
  "specialist_triggering": "Activate team members based on Head Developer's documented tasks",
  "resource_coordination": "Ensure specialists have necessary resources and access",
  "timeline_management": "Coordinate deadlines and dependencies across specialists",
  "escalation_handling": "Address resource conflicts and priority changes"
}
```

### **Escalation Triggers (Asynchronous)**
```json
{
  "immediate_attention": [
    "Critical blocker reported in design_dev_sync.json",
    "Quality standard violations discovered",
    "Customer delivery risk identified",
    "Security or compliance issues found"
  ],
  "next_review_cycle": [
    "Task completion and handoff requests",
    "Resource needs or capacity issues",
    "Timeline risk assessments"
  ],
  "strategic_planning": [
    "Process improvement suggestions",
    "Tool or methodology enhancement ideas",
    "Long-term coordination optimization"
  ]
}
```

### **Conflict Resolution (Head Developer Authority)**
1. **Technical Disputes**: Review specialist recommendations, make final decision
2. **Resource Conflicts**: Prioritize tasks based on business impact and dependencies  
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Adjust scope and communicate changes to affected roles
4. **Quality Standards**: Maintain non-negotiable standards, adjust approach if needed
