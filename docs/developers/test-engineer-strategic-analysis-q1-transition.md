## Q1-AO-MILESTONE-1.2 REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

**Target:** AI Content Pipeline Resilience for >95% autonomous processing  
**Strategic Focus:** DevTeam Integration Excellence  

### Critical Components Identified

#### 1. **E2E Testing Framework** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Gap:** No Playwright, Cypress, or ANY E2E framework exists  
**Risk:** Integration bugs between AI content and rendering WILL crash production  
**Proposal Status:** proposal-011 approved, ready for implementation  

**Required Deliverables:**
- Playwright E2E framework setup with CI/CD integration
- AI content submission → validation → rendering test flow  
- Municipal branding injection E2E validation
- Multi-scene game progression testing
- Performance regression tests in E2E context
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

#### 2. **Component Testing Infrastructure**
**Gap:** 67% of components lack ANY tests (20/35 components)  
**Risk:** Component regressions will break game functionality  
**Strategy:** Systematic component test coverage expansion  

**Proposed Coverage:**
- All React components in src/components/
- Hook testing for custom React hooks
- Integration testing between components
- Props validation and error boundary testing

#### 3. **Security Testing Suite Enhancement**
**Gap:** Limited security testing beyond basic XSS/injection  
**Risk:** AI-generated content could introduce security vulnerabilities  
**Proposal Status:** proposal-018 approved  

**Required Deliverables:**
- Content Security Policy validation
- SVG upload security testing
- Custom font security validation
- Visual regression tests for municipal design integrity

#### 4. **Performance Regression Prevention**
**Gap:** No automated performance budgets or regression alerts  
**Risk:** Q2 features could degrade performance below municipal requirements  
**Proposal Status:** proposal-019 pending review  

**Required Deliverables:**
- Bundle size monitoring with limits
- Loading time budgets per component
- Automated performance regression tests
- CI/CD gates blocking slow builds
