## üéØ FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Psychological Safety in Municipal Training**

#### **Core Requirement:** Absolute Protection of Professional Dignity
- **No Public Shaming:** Performance data remains private unless explicitly shared by the individual
- **No Punitive Mechanics:** Poor performance leads to additional support, never penalties
- **Safe Learning Environment:** Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures
- **Confidential Progress:** Achievement data accessible only to the individual and authorized supervisors

#### **Implementation Standards:**
```
‚úÖ ETHICAL: "You've completed 3 of 5 permit workflows. Would you like additional practice?"
‚ùå UNETHICAL: "You failed 2 workflows. Your ranking dropped to #47 out of 50."

‚úÖ ETHICAL: Private progress dashboard with personalized improvement suggestions
‚ùå UNETHICAL: Public leaderboards comparing municipal employees against each other

‚úÖ ETHICAL: Competency-based progression with multiple paths to success
‚ùå UNETHICAL: Single-metric competition that creates workplace tension
```

#### **Cultural Sensitivity Requirements:**
- **Swedish Context:** Emphasize collaborative improvement and lagom balance
- **German Context:** Respect systematic professional development and thoroughness
- **French Context:** Maintain elegance and intellectual dignity in progress tracking
- **Dutch Context:** Direct feedback with practical improvement focus

### 2. **Avoiding Manipulation Tactics**
