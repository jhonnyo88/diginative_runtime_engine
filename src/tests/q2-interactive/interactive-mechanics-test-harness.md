# Interactive Mechanics Test Harness for Q2 Foundation

## Overview
This test harness provides comprehensive testing framework for Q2 Interactive Mechanics including drag-drop workflows, timed challenges, touch gestures, and accessibility compliance for complex interactions.

## Test Framework Components

### 1. Drag & Drop Interaction Test Utilities
- **Purpose**: Test municipal drag-drop workflows (document routing, process flow assembly)
- **Scope**: Cross-browser drag-drop behavior, touch vs mouse input, accessibility compliance
- **Coverage**: Anna Svensson iPhone 12, desktop administrators, keyboard-only users

### 2. Timer-Based Challenge Test Framework  
- **Purpose**: Test emergency preparedness training scenarios with time constraints
- **Scope**: Timer accuracy, progress tracking, municipal network performance under pressure
- **Coverage**: 3G conditions, session timeout handling, progress persistence

### 3. Touch Gesture Testing for Mobile
- **Purpose**: Validate Anna Svensson mobile experience for Q2 interactive features
- **Scope**: Touch gestures, multi-touch, device orientation, haptic feedback
- **Coverage**: iPhone 12 optimization, Android compatibility, accessibility gestures

### 4. Accessibility Testing for Complex Interactions
- **Purpose**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for interactive Q2 mechanics
- **Scope**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast, cognitive accessibility
- **Coverage**: Municipal employees with disabilities, assistive technology compatibility

### 5. Performance Benchmarks for Interactive Elements
- **Purpose**: Maintain <2s loading for Q2 interactive features
- **Scope**: Animation performance, memory usage, GPU acceleration, municipal network conditions
- **Coverage**: Performance budgets, regression detection, optimization recommendations

### 6. Mock Implementations for Early Validation
- **Purpose**: Test interactive mechanics before full implementation
- **Scope**: Component mocks, API simulation, state management validation
- **Coverage**: Developer experience, rapid prototyping, design validation

## Municipal Context Integration
- Swedish municipal branding validation for interactive elements
- Cultural appropriateness testing for government contexts
- GDPR compliance for interactive data collection
- Municipal network performance optimization (3G baseline)

## Q2 Implementation Coordination
- Alignment with Game Designer's proposal-022 Q2 Interactive Mechanics Foundation
- Integration with existing E2E testing framework (Playwright)
- Extension of real device testing infrastructure (Cypress + BrowserStack)
- Municipal compliance quality gates for interactive features

## Success Metrics
- 100% cross-browser compatibility for drag-drop interactions
- <100ms response time for touch gestures on Anna Svensson iPhone 12
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score >95% for all interactive elements
- Zero performance regressions when interactive mechanics are enabled
- 90% developer satisfaction with mock implementations for rapid iteration
